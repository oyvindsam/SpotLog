## SpotLog
A simple **Spot**ify **Log**ger

SpotLog can keep track of your recently played songs on Spotify so you
don't have to. Ever listened to a hundreds of songs long playlist and
suddenly Spotify crapped out and you lost your position? Enter SpotLog.

In order to use SpotLog you need to manually enable 'Device Broadcast
Status' in Spotify Settings. This will enable other apps on your phone
to know which songs you are listening to.
